## Project Overview

**NotebookLM MCP Server**

This project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides programmatic access to [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com). It allows AI agents and developers to interact with NotebookLM notebooks, sources, and query capabilities.

Tested with personal/free tier accounts. May work with Google Workspace accounts but has not been tested. This project relies on internal APIs (`batchexecute` RPCs).

## Environment & Setup

The project uses `uv` for dependency management and tool installation.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- `uv` (Universal Python Package Manager)
- Google Chrome (for automated authentication)

### Installation

**From PyPI (Recommended):**
```bash
uv tool install notebooklm-mcp-server
# or: pip install notebooklm-mcp-server
```

**From Source (Development):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/notebooklm-mcp.git
cd notebooklm-mcp
uv tool install .
```

## Authentication

**Preferred: Run the automated authentication CLI:**
```bash
notebooklm-mcp-auth
```
This launches Chrome, you log in, and cookies are extracted automatically. Your login is saved to a Chrome profile for future use.

**Auto-refresh (v0.1.9+):**
The server now automatically handles token expiration:
1. Refreshes CSRF tokens on expiry (immediate)
2. Reloads cookies from disk if updated externally
3. Runs headless Chrome auth if profile has saved login

If headless auth fails (Google login fully expired), you'll see a message to run `notebooklm-mcp-auth` again.

**Explicit refresh (MCP tool):**
```
refresh_auth()  # Reload tokens from disk or run headless auth
```

**Fallback: Manual extraction (if CLI fails)**
If the automated tool doesn't work, extract cookies via Chrome DevTools:
1. Open Chrome DevTools on notebooklm.google.com
2. Go to Network tab, find a batchexecute request
3. Copy the Cookie header and call `save_auth_tokens(cookies=...)`

**Environment variable (advanced):**
```bash
export NOTEBOOKLM_COOKIES="SID=xxx; HSID=xxx; SSID=xxx; ..."
```

Cookies last for weeks. The server auto-refreshes as long as Chrome profile login is valid.

## Development Workflow

### Building and Running

**Reinstalling after changes:**
Because `uv tool install` installs into an isolated environment, you must reinstall to see changes during development.
```bash
uv cache clean
uv tool install --force .
```

**Running the Server:**
**Running the Server:**
```bash
# Standard mode (stdio)
notebooklm-mcp

# Debug mode (verbose logging)
notebooklm-mcp --debug

# HTTP Server mode
notebooklm-mcp --transport http --port 8000
```

### Testing

Run the test suite using `pytest` via `uv`:
```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run a specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_api_client.py
```

## Project Structure

- `src/notebooklm_mcp/`
    - `server.py`: Main entry point. Defines the MCP server and tools.
    - `api_client.py`: The core logic. Contains the internal API calls.
    - `constants.py`: Single source of truth for all API code-name mappings.
    - `auth.py`: Handles token validation, storage, and loading.
    - `auth_cli.py`: Implementation of the `notebooklm-mcp-auth` CLI.
- `CLAUDE.md`: Contains detailed documentation on the internal RPC IDs and protocol specifics. **Refer to this file for API deep dives.**
- `pyproject.toml`: Project configuration and dependencies.

## Key Conventions

- **Internal APIs:** This project relies on undocumented APIs. Changes to Google's internal API will break functionality.
- **RPC Protocol:** The API uses Google's `batchexecute` protocol. Responses often contain "anti-XSSI" prefixes (`)]}'`) that must be stripped.
- **Tools:** New features should be exposed as MCP tools in `server.py`.
- **Constants:** All code-name mappings should be defined in `constants.py` using the `CodeMapper` class.
