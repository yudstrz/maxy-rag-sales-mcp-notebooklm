# NotebookLM MCP - Comprehensive Test Plan

**Purpose:** Verify all 31 MCP tools work correctly.

**Prerequisites:**
- MCP server installed: `uv cache clean && uv tool install --force .`
- Valid authentication cookies saved

## Automated Testing with Claude Code or Advanced AI Tools

**You can automate this entire test plan using Claude Code or any advanced AI tool with MCP support!**

### Running Automated Tests

Simply ask your AI assistant to:
```
Run the automated tests from docs/MCP_TEST_PLAN.md. For the Drive sync test,
pause before checking freshness, ask me to make a change to the doc, then
verify both staleness detection and sync functionality work correctly.
```

### How Automation Works

Your AI assistant will:
1. **Execute tests sequentially** - Run through each test group automatically
2. **Track progress** - Use a todo list to show what's being tested
3. **Pause for user input** - Stop at Drive sync test to ask you to modify a document
4. **Validate end-to-end** - Confirm both out-of-sync detection and sync functionality
5. **Report results** - Provide a comprehensive summary of all tests

### Benefits of Automation

- ✅ **Faster testing** - Complete all 30 tools in minutes instead of hours
- ✅ **Consistent validation** - Every tool tested the same way each time
- ✅ **Full coverage** - Every tool tested the same way each time
- ✅ **Interactive verification** - AI pauses for critical validations (like Drive sync)

**Example workflow for Drive sync:**
1. AI adds a Drive document to test notebook
2. AI **pauses** and asks you to modify the doc
3. You make a small change (add text, modify content, etc.)
4. AI checks freshness (should detect `is_fresh: false`)
5. AI syncs the document
6. AI verifies sync worked (`is_fresh: true`)
